This is a report management system.

Stack: JSP, Spring Boot 2, Hibernate, mySQL.

I have also deployed this app on heroku.
Here is the link to the demo: https://reportman.herokuapp.com/login.

How to use: 
There are 3 types of users:
- Employee
- Manager
- Admin

Employee can create new report, view monthy report list and check report monthly status.
Manager cannot create new report but can read reports of every employee and view his/her report list and monthly status.
Admin is like a manager but with system management authority which allows he/she to create new manager or admin account and edit all accounts' info.
All users can edit their own account info.

Default admin account: 

email: admin@tas.com

password: admin
